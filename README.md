# Familiar Tower Defense
This project was a class project for a game dev class using the schools game engine.
The only files that are uploaded are files that my team worked on and they do not work on their own. There are around 8 extra helper files that allowed us to use the engine. This does not include the engine itself or any of the DirectX12 files.

The game can be played by downloading the .exe file and the media folder. The folder and the .exe have to be in the same location for the game to run.
